Supporting sustainable, resilient ports and cities.

The Australia-Indonesia Centre Infrastructure Cluster investigated the built, political, social and natural environments of Indonesia’s ports and transport networks. Its research will help ensure that the many large-scale maritime and land transport infrastructure projects in the pipeline will be resilient, efficient, and able to support the massive economic growth Indonesia is experiencing.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
— Developing a fibre-optic sensor for pipeline monitoring, predictive models of train dynamics and bridge life expectancy, a hybrid framework for the non-destructive testing of infrastructure, a dataset of container logistics in Indonesia, and container logistics simulation software.

— Producing 16 refereed publications, with many more in the pipeline.

— Hosting a special session on infrastructure modelling at the 6th Asia Pacific Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring in Hobart, Tasmania, 7-9 December 2016.

— Delivering an end-of-research workshop in Surabaya to showcase outcomes from the research program in May 2018. This workshop was attended by representatives of the Indonesian Government, The Indonesian Railway Company, Regional Water Company, Indonesian Transport Offices from both national and regional level, Port Authorities from East Javanese ports of Teluk Lamong and Surabaya, as well as road transport and railway industry representatives.

— Supporting exchange visits of Indonesian students to Melbourne and Australian students to Indonesia, as well as providing many professional development opportunities for researchers.

— Fostering research relationships that will extend beyond the life of the AIC Infrastructure Cluster. Notable connections include the good working relationship between the Institute of Rail Technology at Monash University and the Jakarta MRT, and the collaborative research work on fibre optics between Monash University and the Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) Surabaya.

— Emphasising the central role of stakeholders and end-users. Stakeholders outside the university sector included port and railway authorities in Australia and Indonesia, engineers, policy makers, and experts in private industry. Key stakeholders were engaged throughout to facilitate and develop relationships around data sharing. Notable relationships were established with PT Teluk Lamong, PT Jasamarga Surabaya Mojokerto, Pelindo III and Jakarta MRT.
