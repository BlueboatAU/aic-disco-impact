## Improving productivity of farmers.

The Food and Agriculture Cluster’s work was highlighted by the groundbreaking project ‘Sustainability and profitability of cocoabased farming in Sulawesi’. Researchers from Universitas Hasanuddin, the University of Sydney and Institut Pertanian Bogor took interdisciplinary research to a new level, ultimately providing many lessons in research practice on top of their core findings.<!--more-->

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS 
1. Three stakeholder workshops were held in Sulawesi, and all received positive feedback on the use of integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to finding solutions. Stakeholders from the district government’s health and agricultural sectors, the cocoa industry, farmer organisations, senior vets and university academics attended the workshops. A new, integrated approach to address farmers’ livelihood concerns was developed. 

1. AIC project members presented in the general assembly meetings of the Cocoa Sustainability Partnership (CSP), the foremost forum for the cocoa industry in Indonesia, which raised further CSP interest in the project. 

1. Swiss Contact have expressed interest in using AIC project results to inform their program development. UTZ Certified have also instigated a study on gender roles, and the consultant has requested information produced on gender in the AIC project. Data from the project accessible through the CSP contributed to developing programs concerned with community livelihood. 

1. Discussion of the project’s research findings has raised awareness within the Directorate General of Plantations at the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture. Strategies to raise cocoa productivity have become a major topic for discussion within this Ministry. 

1. David Guest, through his participation on the Mars Chocolate Research Advisory Board, has briefed the industry on constraints and options for cocoa production in Indonesia. As a result, a Mars Chocolate delegation visited the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research in June 2018 to discuss co-funding research in Indonesia. 

1. Mapping soil and socioecoomic data to drive better decisions on land-use and improve food security across Indonesia. 

1. In-depth research on the challenges facing Indonesia’s small-island fishing communities, which are dealing with the impacts of falling fish stocks, along with numerous environmental, social and economic changes. 

1. Recommendations on strengthening and expanding the Indonesian food-processing industry, a significant and growing contributor to the Indonesian economy.
