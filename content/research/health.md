## Innovative approaches to address primary prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases.

Maintaining the health and wellbeing of young people is of paramount importance to a society’s sustainable growth and advancement. Investing in human capital should always go hand-inhand with the building of infrastructure and markets, and will be the key to Indonesia’s success in this century; it will be just as vital for Australia’s continued growth.<!--more-->

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS 
1. Creating a detailed Indonesian energy technology assessment (IETA) projecting the future cost of generating power via different technologies. The report will help planners and policymakers make informed decisions about the future of Indonesia’s energy network. It was presented at a forum at the Australian Embassy Jakarta in 2018.

1. Securing APEC funding for the project titled “Integrated energy system planning for equitable access to sustainable energy for remote communities in the APEC regions using North Sulawesi as a pilot project/ testbed.” Researchers from Monash, Institut Teknologi Bandung and Institut Pertanian Bogor are engaging with communities in North Sulawesi, City of Bitung and Universitas Sam Ratulangi to model a Low Carbon Model Town initiative. 

1. Attracting a $100,000 commitment from CWP Renewables, a global company with business activities in both Australia and Indonesia. 

1. Working with the European Climate Foundation fund to develop a state-of-the art analysis of the renewable transformation potential for the Java-Bali power system. 

1. Building deep and lasting research networks between Australian and Indonesian academics and institutions. 

1. Evaluating the potential for biofuel use and production in Indonesia’s future energy mix. 

1. Developing models for the design and installation of microgrids in remote communities, taking into account specific economic, social and cultural factors and examining the impacts of electrification. 

1. Creating robust models for the integration of cleanenergy microgrids into large-scale transmission systems. 

1. Developing a novel method of measuring fouling on a ship’s hull, a technology with the potential to deliver significant widespread economic and environmental benefits to the global transport industry. 

1. Evaluating options for large-scale generation and storage of renewable energy, including identification of potential pumped hydro energy storage sites and enumerating the benefits of deep decarbonisation of the Indonesian economy. 

1. Presentations to government and industry aim to shape policies and advance technologies to help reach Indonesia’s renewable energy targets set by President Joko Widodo’s government.
